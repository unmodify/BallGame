@strategy to create more whites 
*bite tail causes body to head to stick to remainder, cut loop becomes, separate and contracting
*form a planet by making clumps of yourself
*form galaxies, or black holes to finish the level
*only move ants to player when they move
*mouse wheel zooms? and slows time
*shoot tail to cut and close off the space
*shots bounce other colors into each other
*ants hit yellow, they absorb into it
*ants avoid white
*shots kill ants and so does debris
*planets attract yellow and then ants colonize 
*another player with tail and shots hit tail
*w/ added colors same color grows, complementary color shrinks, adjunct sticks, oblique bounces
*size of debris cloud creates a force push on local npcs / debris, scales on debri size
*move parallax
*some space clouds moving in background
*slow random move npc, collision clumps or breaks based on speed and angle
    *npc joints, because of collision
AI:
*ai player congtroller, behaviors, feed into movement and shooting
 decide between shooting and seeking npcs
*add ai controlled players, move around collecting and growing as well
*fairy moving around, can chase, drops speed ups, or inc mouse range
 *interesting, mouse pushes instead of pulls
*invert the mouse effect near anomalies
*shots cause clumping/compression depending on target hit
*instead of head blowing up, size moves down tail, till ejects as white mass
*ants stick to body and cut loose parts over time...or colonize with yellow growth
*review components for attachments
*make debris move away from hit direction, based on shot size, force fields
 *some shots attract items as they pass, some move, some chain react
*make head change color as npc increase, keep a list, over time pass down body
*till eject
*SONAR: sending out a wave, show lines on head for contacts, large objects will 
 trigger a bunched signal
*add creature that talks and gives quests

*make two at different distances, mouse wheel to  change distance, angle from midline, creates effect
 as well as movement
*construct with attractors, create fields on clumps
*create energy flows
*sun gives fire
*ice freezes
*atmosphere give electric charge
*atmosphere give chemical charge
